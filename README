== Features/Problems

- You can make a presentation by using your favorite terminal.
- You need to configure font size of terminal by yourself.
- You can't use pictures, yet.
  Making pictures into ASCII art is a future work ;-)
- You must encode presentation files as EUC-JP if you want to use Japanese.
  This limitation comes from ruby-ncurses.
